Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The client was asking to develop a system know as the DriverPass project. This project was to help improve the driving learnign process and ultimately increase the amount of students passing their driving exams. They want the DriverPass system to offer online courses as well as online practice tests that the user (students) can take to learn and test their knwoledge. The system also offers for the users to schedule on the road training as well as manage appointments with their driving instructors. The users can also view their progress as and see the feedback from their instructors on how their training is going. 

What did you do particularly well?
  
  One particular task that I did well was plan out the system and design it. Each requirement was accounted for and the design was planned, step by step. The design contained a user friendly interface that shows the simplified system on scheduling and managing the student's on the road training. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 
  I would revise how the scalability of the system is designed. The DriverPass project was designed with a low amount of users in mind. I would improve the data management to be more flexible so if the system has a larger amount of traffic, it doesn't slow down or cause problems with performance. Student's would be less likely to use the system if it takes a long time to load or is constantly crashing. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 
  To understand the user's needs, I ensured that the system was easy to use and understand. By making the system as user friendly as possible, it ensures that the user would have a better experience. It is important to think about the users when designing the system because they are the ones that will be using it. The system needs to be simple but it should also offer everything that is needed to satisfy the requirments. 
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
 
  I approach designing software by first understanding the requirments. My overall goal is to satisfy each requirement while also providing a simple and easy to use user interface. I created use cases, protyping, and usability testing to ensure this. In the future, I plan to follow the Agile development principles more closesly throughout the project. This allows for continuous improvement as well as adaptation to the user's needs in the future.
